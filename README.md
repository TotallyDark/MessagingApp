### Introduction
- For this project, our goal is to make a program similar to Instagram and Wechat where different users can be able to interact with each other on the App. 
- In this program, it will include specific functions such as:
     
  1. Text messaging to a specific user
  2. Users can upload specific files/pictures/ or texts in a place where every user's friend could be able to see it and comment to it. 
  3. The part where users can be able to modify their own name, profiles, and other additional informations.
